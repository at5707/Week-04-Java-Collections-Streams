Overview 
The fourth week was dedicated to understanding the concepts of Java Collections and Streams in the Java programming language. We covered the concepts related to Java Generics and collections the first two days. Then we learnt about the various Java IO Streams with several types of streams such as FileStreams, ObjectStreams, ByteArrayStreams, BufferedStreams and Reader & Writer. We also learnt about the different types of exceptions, learnt about Regex & JUnit and finally we learnt about the features of Java 8. We run JUnit and Java 8 in Eclipse IDE.
